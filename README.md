# Hello, I’m Jodahoney 👋
*(aka Joseph Dehoney, Joe, or Joda)*

🎓 **M.S. Computer Science @ Stanford (2024–2026)**  
I’m interested in **machine learning** (theory, systems, applications), **quantum information theory**, and work at their intersection.

**Core interests**
- **Learning theory:** identifiability, generalization, and complexity-aware modeling choices  
- **Robust ML systems:** reproducible data/model pipelines with strong validation and monitoring  
- **Scalable training:** distributed and memory-aware workflows for large multimodal and graph data  
- **Applied scientific ML:** biomedical and neuroimaging workflows  
- **ML × Quantum:** learning under physical constraints; theory → implementable algorithms; scientific tooling

## What I’m working on (recent)
- **Computer vision for remote exercise interventions:** exercise recognition + rep counting from home-based training videos (toward a deployable remote exercise trainer).
- **ML systems for multimodal biomedical/neuroimaging data:** reproducible pipelines, CI validation, and scalable release workflows.
- **Graph ML systems:** memory-aware training workflows in PyTorch Geometric.
